# Chimney HTTPS Test Configuration
#
# This configuration demonstrates manual HTTPS setup with self-signed certificates.
# Perfect for local development and testing.
#
# Usage:
#   cargo run -- --config test-https/chimney.toml
#
# Then visit:
#   - HTTP:  http://localhost:8080 (will redirect to HTTPS)
#   - HTTPS: https://localhost (accept security warning for self-signed cert)

host = "0.0.0.0"
port = 8080  # HTTP listener
# HTTPS automatically runs on port 443

sites_directory = "test-https/sites"
log_level = "debug"

# NOTE: Site-specific HTTPS configuration is in:
#   sites/localhost/chimney.toml
#
# The HTTPS config includes:
#   - Manual certificate mode (auto_issue = false)
#   - Self-signed certificates for localhost
#   - Automatic HTTP → HTTPS redirect
