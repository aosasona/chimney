I thought to myself; “How hard could it be? I already write a bit of react, I could easily learn a bit of react native over the weekend and just build something out” (spoiler; it took about two weekends), and that what I did, I wanted it to do a limited number of things:</p>
<ul>
<li>Make it easy to pick up where I stopped</li>
<li>Make it easy to find things in the library (search, obviously)</li>
<li>Have a UI that actually felt like it was a library and not a glorified file explorer</li>
<li>Contain details about the book (preferably fetched from the internet)</li>
</ul>
<p>Just before I was about to kick back, I showed it off to a few people and they liked it and wanted it, and I began to think “What if I made it a bit better and opened it up to more people?“. At this time, unlike other things I had/have worked on, I hadn’t even bought a domain, I had no intention to even build a website for it but when I tried to get it into Google and Apple’s beta programs, I realised I needed a privacy policy, so I paused, went on Figma, designed a landing page to at least help people understand what it was… and never used the design in the final website as always.</p>
<p>To my surprise, even though this was my first mobile app and it sucked (imho) and was a bit unstable (some may say even slow), people received it well, the tweet I made at a time I knew no one was awake somehow still got attention and by the end of the second week, the app had well over 250 users and in the first week, I had started to see some sort of potential and ‘what it could be’. I started to borrow ideas from another app idea I was working on but never shipped because at the time, I did not really take the time or had the will to learn React Native (Flutter folks, no, do not
write that comment)</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I personally do not support React Native over Flutter or the other way, React Native made more sense to use since I was already familiar with React.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I had fun working on the app, I probably spent too much time working on it, it was an exciting process really, it even gave me the opportunity to have a talk with the Daniel Gross, whew! I mean, at this point, I just had to go harder, and I did. I added ePub and I hated everything about that, both renderers (PDF and EPUB) weren’t great and I had to do some silly workarounds to make the app somewhat usable and I did not like that I had to settle. You see, I wanted it to really have a good UX, it’s not the first reader out there, obviously, so I knew I had to make it different by making it minimal and easy to understand. I was stuck; I hated the way I had to do things and I couldn’t do them myself either, I had never written a react native library, I did not know Swift or Java for the native bindings even if I wanted to and I thought about rebuilding the whole app in Swift and sticking to one platform that way.</p>
<p>This is when it started to dawn on me, I built this thing <strong>FOR ME</strong> so I could get some reading done but I never even read any of the books, I had spent more time building an app to help others read but I was getting nowhere with my own books haha. I have always been more of an <em>“audio learner”</em> so the books I actually did read were Audiobooks on Audible. I started to ask myself “Is it worth spending the next few months learning Swift and putting in all that work to build something I don’t even use while also losing the Android user base (which was well over 65% of total users at the time)?” and the answer for me was “NO”. I did not want to work on the app anymore, I still wanted to have my docs organised and all so I intend to hack on that in the future but do I want to keep spending time building the reading app? not quite.</p>
<p>I know a lot of people still use the app so I am working on one last feature; folders (I might find it useful too), I was initially going to just totally stop working on it but I figured I would open up the source code so that others could add features they wanted to their version or make a PR (I would definitely review and update the app) but none of the major updates if any at all would be coming from me. I might still work on a few things here and there in my free time but I’m not making any promises.</p>
<p>As soon as I am done working on that feature and doing a bit of refactoring, I would be submitting it for public release on the App Stores and opening up the source on Github too. Thanks a lot for the support when I first released the app and after, can’t wait to share other things I am working on with you soon! :)</p></main><footer class="max-w-6xl flex justify-between items-center border-t border-neutral-900 mt-10 mx-auto py-8 px-6"><p class="text-xs text-center font-medium text-neutral-700 py-1">
